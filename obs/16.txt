After Joshua died, the Israelites disobeyed God and did not drive out the rest of the Canaanites or obey God’s laws. The Israelites began to worship the Canaanite gods instead of the One True God. The Israelites had no king, so everyone did what they thought was right for them.

As a result of this disobedience, God punished the Israelites by allowing them to be defeated by their enemies. These enemies stole from the Israelites, destroyed their property, and killed many of them. After many years, the Israelites repented and asked God to rescue them.

Then God provided a deliverer who rescued them from their enemies and brought peace to the land. But then the people forgot about God and started worshiping idols again. So God allowed the Midianites, a nearby enemy tribe, to defeat them.

They took all of the Israelites’ crops for seven years. The Israelites were so scared, they hid in caves so the Midianites would not find them. Finally, they cried out to God to save them.

One day, a man named Gideon was secretly harvesting grain so the Midianites would not steal it. The angel of God came to Gideon and said, “God is with you, mighty warrior. Go and save Israel from the Midianites.”

God told Gideon to tear down his father’s idol. Gideon was afraid of the people, so he waited until nighttime. Then he tore down the idol and smashed it to pieces. He built an altar to God where the idol used to be and made a sacrifice to God.

The next morning the people saw that the idol had been torn down, and they were very angry. They went to Gideon’s house to kill him, but Gideon’s father said, “Why are you trying to help your gods? If they are gods, let them protect themselves!” So Gideon was saved.

Then the Midianites came again to steal from the Israelites. There were so many of them that they could not be counted. Gideon called the Israelites together to fight them. Gideon asked God for two signs so he could be sure that God would use him to save Israel.

First, he laid a cloth on the ground and asked God to let the morning dew fall only on the cloth and not on the ground. God did that. The next night, he asked that the ground be wet but the cloth dry. God did that too.

32,000 Israelite soldiers came to Gideon, but God told him this was too many. So Gideon sent home 22,000 who were too scared to fight. God told Gideon that he still had too many men. So Gideon sent all of them home except for 300 soldiers.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-11.jpg}}

That night God told Gideon, “Go down to the Midianite camp and when you hear what they say, you will no longer be afraid.” So that night, Gideon went down to the camp and heard a Midianite soldier telling his friend about a dream. The man’s friend said, “This dream means that Gideon will defeat Midian!” Gideon worshiped God.

Then Gideon returned to his soldiers and gave each of them a horn, a clay pot, and a torch. They surrounded the place where the Midianites were sleeping. The 300 men had the torches in the pots so they could not be seen.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-13.jpg}}

Then, at the same time, they all broke the pots that were hiding the torches. They blew their horns and shouted, “A sword for God and for Gideon!”

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-14.jpg}}

God confused the Midianites, so that they attacked each other and started killing each other. Immediately, the rest of the Israelites were called from their homes to come help chase the Midianites. They killed many of them and chased the rest of them out of their land. 120,000 Midianites died that day. God had saved Israel.

The people wanted to make Gideon their king. Gideon wisely refused their offer, but he asked them for some of the money that each of them had taken from the enemy. Gideon received a lot of money.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-16.jpg}}

Then Gideon did a foolish thing. He made an idol with the money, and the people turned away from God again. They started worshiping Gideon’s idol.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-17.jpg}}

God punished Israel again for worshiping idols. Their enemies defeated them. They finally asked God for help, and God sent them another deliverer. This pattern of sin, punishment, repentance, and deliverance was repeated many times. God sent many deliverers who saved Israel from their enemies.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-18.jpg}}

Finally, the people asked God for a king like all the other nations had. They wanted a king who was tall, strong, and could lead them into battle. God did not like this request, but He gave them what they wanted.
